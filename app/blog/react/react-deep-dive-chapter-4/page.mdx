In the previous chapters, we've seen how <TextHighlight theme="default" href="/blog/react/react-deep-dive-chapter-2" internal>Fiber</TextHighlight> breaks down rendering work into units and maintains <TextHighlight theme="default" href="/blog/react/react-deep-dive-chapter-3" internal>two trees</TextHighlight> for reconciliation. Now, let's explore how Fiber manages different types of updates and their priorities to ensure a responsive user experience.

## Types of Updates in React

React handles several types of updates, each with different priorities:

1. **User Interactions** (Highest Priority)
   - Click events
   - Input changes
   - Keyboard events
   - These need immediate response

2. **Visual Updates** (High Priority)
   - Hover states
   - Focus changes
   - These affect user feedback

3. **Data Updates** (Normal Priority)
   - State changes
   - Props updates
   - These drive the application logic

4. **Background Tasks** (Low Priority)
   - Data prefetching
   - Analytics
   - These can be delayed

## The Priority System

React defines several priority levels to manage these updates:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`const PriorityLevels = {
    ImmediatePriority: 1,    // User interactions
    UserBlockingPriority: 2, // Hover, focus
    NormalPriority: 3,       // Data updates
    LowPriority: 4,         // Background updates
    IdlePriority: 5         // Non-essential updates
};`}
</CodeBlock>

## How Fiber Manages Priorities

When an update occurs, Fiber:

**Step 1: Assigns a Priority**
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// Example: User clicks a button
const update = {
    type: 'CLICK',
    priority: ImmediatePriority,
    payload: { /* event data */ }
};`}
</CodeBlock>

**Step 2: Schedules the Update**
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function scheduleUpdate(fiber, priority) {
    // Schedule based on priority
    if (priority === ImmediatePriority) {
        // Execute immediately
        performSyncWork(fiber);
    } else {
        // Schedule for later
        scheduleCallback(priority, () => performWork(fiber));
    }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

**Step 3: Processes Updates in Order**
- High priority updates interrupt lower priority ones
- Lower priority updates can be deferred
- Background work can be paused

## Real-World Example

Let's see how this works in practice:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

    // High priority: User interaction
    const handleClick = () => {
        setCount(c => c + 1);  // Immediate update
    };

    // Normal priority: Data fetching
    useEffect(() => {
        fetchData().then(setData);  // Can be deferred
    }, []);

    // Low priority: Analytics
    useEffect(() => {
        reportAnalytics(count);  // Can be delayed
    }, [count]);

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>
                Count: {count}
            </button>
            {data && <div>{data}</div>}
        </div>
    );
}`}
</CodeBlock>

In this example:
1. The click handler runs immediately (ImmediatePriority)
2. The data fetch can be deferred (NormalPriority)
3. The analytics update can be delayed (LowPriority)

## Benefits of Priority-Based Updates

1. **Responsive UI**
   - User interactions are processed immediately
   - The UI remains responsive even during heavy updates
   - Background work doesn't block the main thread

2. **Efficient Resource Usage**
   - Important updates get CPU time first
   - Less important updates can be batched
   - System resources are used optimally

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Immediate feedback for user actions
   - No UI freezes during updates

## The Role of Data Structures

To efficiently manage these priorities, React uses a priority queue implementation (which we'll explore in detail in our <TextHighlight theme="default" href="/blog/algorithm/heap" internal>heap data structure post</TextHighlight>). For now, it's important to understand that:

1. Updates are stored in order of priority
2. High-priority updates can interrupt lower-priority ones
3. The system maintains a consistent order of processing


In the next chapter, we'll explore the commit phase in detail, focusing on:
- How React handles different types of effects
- The three sub-phases of the commit phase
- How <TextHighlight theme='code'>useEffect</TextHighlight> works under the hood
- The timing and execution of effects
- How React ensures consistency during commits
