## <div className="text-center">Chapter 3: Fiber's Reconciliation Process</div>

In the previous chapter, we learned how Fiber breaks rendering work into small units. Now, let's explore how Fiber handles updates and reconciliation. The key to understanding this process is the concept of the <TextHighlight theme="default">workInProgress</TextHighlight> tree.

## The Two Trees

Fiber maintains two trees during the reconciliation process:

1. **Current Tree**: The tree that's currently rendered on the screen
2. **WorkInProgress Tree**: The tree being built for the next render

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// Simplified representation of the two trees
let currentTree = null;      // The current tree
let workInProgressTree = null;  // The tree being built

function createWorkInProgress(current, pendingProps) {
    let workInProgress = current.alternate;
    if (workInProgress === null) {
        // Create a new fiber if we don't have one
        workInProgress = createFiber(
            current.type,
            pendingProps,
            current.key
        );
        workInProgress.alternate = current;
        current.alternate = workInProgress;
    } else {
        // Reuse the existing fiber
        workInProgress.pendingProps = pendingProps;
        workInProgress.effectTag = NoEffect;
        workInProgress.nextEffect = null;
        workInProgress.firstEffect = null;
        workInProgress.lastEffect = null;
    }
    return workInProgress;
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## The Reconciliation Process

The reconciliation process follows these steps:

1. **Begin Work**: Start building the workInProgress tree
2. **Complete Work**: Finish processing a fiber node
3. **Commit Work**: Apply changes to the DOM

Here's how it works:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function beginWork(current, workInProgress, renderLanes) {
    // 1. Check if we can reuse the current fiber
    if (current !== null) {
        const oldProps = current.memoizedProps;
        const newProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;
        
        if (oldProps !== newProps) {
            // Props changed, mark for update
            workInProgress.effectTag |= Update;
        }
    }

    // 2. Process the fiber based on its type
    switch (workInProgress.tag) {
        case FunctionComponent:
            return updateFunctionComponent(current, workInProgress);
        case HostComponent:
            return updateHostComponent(current, workInProgress);
        // ... other cases
    }
}

function completeWork(current, workInProgress) {
    const newProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;

    switch (workInProgress.tag) {
        case HostComponent: {
            // Create or update DOM node
            if (current !== null && workInProgress.stateNode != null) {
                // Update existing node
                updateHostComponent(current, workInProgress);
            } else {
                // Create new node
                const instance = createInstance(workInProgress.type, newProps);
                workInProgress.stateNode = instance;
            }
            break;
        }
        // ... other cases
    }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Effect List

Fiber maintains an effect list to track which nodes need updates:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function completeUnitOfWork(unitOfWork) {
    let completedWork = unitOfWork;
    do {
        const current = completedWork.alternate;
        const returnFiber = completedWork.return;

        // Append effects to the effect list
        if (returnFiber !== null && (completedWork.effectTag & Incomplete) === NoEffect) {
            if (returnFiber.firstEffect === null) {
                returnFiber.firstEffect = completedWork.firstEffect;
            }
            if (completedWork.lastEffect !== null) {
                if (returnFiber.lastEffect !== null) {
                    returnFiber.lastEffect.nextEffect = completedWork.firstEffect;
                }
                returnFiber.lastEffect = completedWork.lastEffect;
            }
        }
    } while (completedWork !== null);
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## The Commit Phase

After the workInProgress tree is complete, React enters the commit phase:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function commitRoot(root) {
    const finishedWork = root.finishedWork;
    
    // 1. Commit all the side effects
    commitMutationEffects(finishedWork);
    
    // 2. Switch the current and workInProgress trees
    root.current = finishedWork;
    
    // 3. Commit layout effects
    commitLayoutEffects(finishedWork);
}`}
</CodeBlock>

This is a simplified view of the commit phase. In <TextHighlight theme="code" href="/blog/react/react-deep-dive-chapter-5" internal>Chapter 5</TextHighlight>, we'll dive deeper into:
- How React handles different types of effects
- The three sub-phases of the commit phase
- How React ensures consistency during commits
- The role of layout effects and their timing

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Incremental Updates**: Changes can be applied incrementally without blocking the main thread
2. **Consistent UI**: The current tree remains stable while the workInProgress tree is being built
3. **Optimized Performance**: Only necessary updates are applied to the DOM
4. **Better Error Handling**: If an error occurs, we can fall back to the current tree

## Example: Updating a Component

Let's see how this works in practice with a state update:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Increment
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}`}
</CodeBlock>

When the button is clicked, here's what happens:

1. **State Update Triggered**
   - <TextHighlight theme="code">setCount</TextHighlight> is called, triggering a state update
   - React schedules a re-render for the component

2. **WorkInProgress Tree Creation**
   - React creates a new workInProgress tree
   - The tree is built incrementally, one fiber at a time

3. **Reconciliation Process**
   - The Counter fiber is marked for update
   - The text node containing the count is marked for update
   - Other nodes (div, button, etc.) are reused without changes

4. **Commit Phase**
   - The new count value is committed to the DOM
   - The workInProgress tree becomes the current tree
   - The UI reflects the updated count

This example shows how Fiber:
1. Handles state updates efficiently by only updating what changed
2. Maintains consistency between the current and workInProgress trees
3. Optimizes performance by reusing unchanged parts of the tree
4. Ensures smooth updates without blocking the main thread

In the next chapter, we'll explore how Fiber handles different types of updates and priorities.
