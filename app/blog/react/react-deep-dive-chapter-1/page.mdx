# <div className="text-center">React Deep Dive</div>
## <div className="text-center">Chapter 1: The Problems with Pre-React 16</div>

I remember when I first looked at my job's projects and saw the <TextHighlight theme="danger">UNSAFE_</TextHighlight> prefix on <TextHighlight theme="code">componentWillMount</TextHighlight>, <TextHighlight theme="code">componentWillReceiveProps</TextHighlight>, and <TextHighlight theme="code">componentWillUpdate</TextHighlight>. 
I had no idea what they were, so I hovered over them and read the comments above them. Unfortunately, I still couldn't understand them at all. 
This gap in understanding became the driving force behind my deep dive into React's architecture. 

After working with React for several years and studying its internals, I've come to understand the why, what, and how behind React's design. By writing this blog, I aim to solidify my knowledge while hopefully helping others navigate React's core concepts more clearly.

## What does JSX convert to?
<div className="flex gap-4">
<CodeBlock language="jsx" className="flex-1">
{`// JSX Syntax
function App() {
    return (
        <div className="app">
            <h1>Hello React!</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        </div>
    );
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="javascript" className="flex-1">
{`// Compiled JavaScript
function App() {
    return React.createElement(
        'div',
        { className: 'app' },
        [
            React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello React!'),
            React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a paragraph')
        ]
    );
}`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

JSX is transformed to JavaScript by build tools like Babel. The transformation replaces the code inside the tags with a call to <TextHighlight theme="code">createElement</TextHighlight>, passing the tag name, the props, and the children as parameters.

Starting from React 17, Babel uses a new JSX transform that uses <TextHighlight theme="code">_jsx</TextHighlight> instead of <TextHighlight theme="code">React.createElement</TextHighlight>. Let's look at a direct comparison using our example:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// React.createElement (Pre-React 17)
function App() {
    return React.createElement(
        'div',
        { className: 'app' },
        [
            React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello React!'),
            React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a paragraph')
        ]
    );
}

// _jsx (React 17+)
function App() {
    return _jsx("div", {
        className: "app",
        children: [
            _jsx("h1", {
                children: "Hello React!"
            }),
            _jsx("p", {
                children: "This is a paragraph"
            })
        ]
    });
}`}
</CodeBlock>

The new transform has several advantages:
1. It's more performant as it doesn't need to create intermediate arrays for children
2. It automatically imports the necessary functions, so you don't need to import React just to use JSX
3. It produces cleaner and more readable code

Both transforms ultimately create the same element object structure that we will discuss later. The main difference is in how they get there and their runtime performance.
For now we can just stick to <TextHighlight theme="code">React.createElement</TextHighlight>.

## What does React.createElement return?

The <TextHighlight theme="code">React.createElement</TextHighlight> function returns a plain JavaScript object that represents a React element. This object has a specific structure that React uses to build the DOM. Here's what the element object looks like for our example:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        className: 'app',
        children: [
            {
                type: 'h1',
                props: {
                    children: [
                        {
                            type: 'TEXT_ELEMENT',
                            props: {
                                nodeValue: 'Hello React!',
                                children: []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                type: 'p',
                props: {
                    children: [
                        {
                            type: 'TEXT_ELEMENT',
                            props: {
                                nodeValue: 'This is a paragraph',
                                children: []
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}`}
</CodeBlock>
When dealing with primitive values like strings or numbers, React wraps them in a special element type called <TextHighlight theme="code">TEXT_ELEMENT</TextHighlight>.
The <TextHighlight theme="code">TEXT_ELEMENT</TextHighlight> is a special type that React uses internally to handle text nodes. In the render function, when it encounters a <TextHighlight theme="code">TEXT_ELEMENT</TextHighlight>, it creates a text node using <TextHighlight theme="code">document.createTextNode()</TextHighlight> instead of a regular DOM element.

This element object is what gets passed to the <TextHighlight theme="code">render</TextHighlight> function. It's a lightweight description of what should appear on the screen, containing:
- **type**: The type of the element (either a string for HTML elements or a function/class for components)
- **props**: An object containing all the properties, including <TextHighlight theme="code">children</TextHighlight> which can be a string, number, or an array of more element objects

## From JavaScript to DOM

Once we have our JavaScript element, we need to render it to the DOM. This typically happens with:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`const element = <App />;
const container = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(element, container);`}
</CodeBlock>

The <TextHighlight theme="code">render</TextHighlight> function is responsible for creating the actual DOM nodes and appending them to the container. Here's a simplified version of how it works:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function render(element, container) {
    const dom =
      element.type == "TEXT_ELEMENT"
        ? document.createTextNode("")
        : document.createElement(element.type)

    const isProperty = key => key !== "children"
    Object.keys(element.props)
      .filter(isProperty)
      .forEach(name => {
        dom[name] = element.props[name]
      })

    element.props.children.forEach(child =>
      render(child, dom)
    )

    container.appendChild(dom)
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## The Problem with Recursive Rendering

This implementation has a critical flaw: it uses recursive calls to render the entire element tree. The <TextHighlight theme="code">render</TextHighlight> function will keep calling itself for each child element until the entire tree is built. This means:

1. The main thread is blocked until the entire tree is rendered
2. If the tree is large, it can cause the UI to become unresponsive
3. There's no way to pause or interrupt the rendering process
4. High-priority updates (like user input) have to wait for the entire tree to be rendered

This was a fundamental limitation in React versions before 16. The recursive nature of the render process made it impossible to implement features like:
- Concurrent rendering
- Time-slicing
- Priority-based updates

In the next chapter, we'll explore how React 16's Fiber architecture solved these problems by introducing an interruptible rendering process.
